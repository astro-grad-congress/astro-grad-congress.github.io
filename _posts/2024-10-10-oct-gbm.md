The Astro Grad Congress (AGC) held its October General Body Meeting on **October 10th, 2025**, with **15 graduate representatives** in attendance. We’re excited to share a quick recap of what we discussed, what we’re working on, and how you can get involved!

### Meeting Format

We’ve launched a **new meeting format** to make space for both updates and collaborative work:
- **20 minutes** for announcements and subcommittee updates  
- **30 minutes** of breakout room time for subcommittees to coordinate, co-work, and set goals
- **5 minutes** to recap and share across groups  

We’ll continue using this structure in future meetings.

### Steering Committee Meetings

AGC steering committee meetings are now **open to all reps**! These are informal spaces to co-work, brainstorm, and chat with the team. We meet **every other Friday morning**—if you'd like to join, feel free to reach out and we’ll share the details.

### Subcommittee Breakout Rooms

After voting on which initiatives we want to prioritize, we broke into subcommittees to begin planning and organizing. Here’s a quick look at what each group is working on:

#### Unionization  
This group discussed the **stages of organizing** across various departments, strategies for **advocating for stipend increases**, and ways to ensure **international student involvement**. They also shared concerns about departments discouraging organizing efforts—and reminded folks that such actions are **not legally allowed**.

#### Grad Involvement in Faculty Hiring  
This team is working to **compile information** on how graduate students participate in faculty hiring processes across institutions. The goal is to **advocate for best practices** and support departments in creating **more inclusive and transparent hiring structures**.

#### Community Building  
This group shared examples of **community-building programs** at their home departments and discussed how they contribute to **equity and a sense of belonging**, especially for underrepresented students. The group plans to **collect data** to highlight the importance of strong department communities.

#### Outreach Database  
This team is compiling a **list of public engagement initiatives** in astronomy to **centralize resources** and **inspire new efforts**. They’re designing a short survey to gather contributions and aim to encourage **collaboration across institutions**.

### How to Get Involved

All subcommittees are **open to any interested reps**, and you’re welcome to join even if you’re not able to contribute regularly. There’s no pressure to commit—just join in when you can!
